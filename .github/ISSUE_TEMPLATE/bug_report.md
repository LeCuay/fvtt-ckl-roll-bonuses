**Additional context**
If there's a specific actor you're having issues with, please attach that actor here. To export an actor, go to your actors tab and right click on the actor. Upload the json file here.

Providing me with the actor means I will be able to import and reproduce the issue is. If there is not already a buff/feature/item configured with your problem on this actor, it will be much harder for me to reproduce and fix it.
