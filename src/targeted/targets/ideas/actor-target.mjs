// when buff is activated, open DocumentSheet that shows a list of tokens/actors in the scene. Pre-select the tokens that the user has targeted. Never assume the targets if the buff isn't active
// target input has a formula for determining the number of targets
// target hint shows label if inactive, or target names if active.
// add safety for when tokens are deleted
// target is determined by the tokens actively being targeted
