On the skills tab in the top right is a button for modifying your base inspiration die. It defaults to `1d6[Inspiration]`, it's modifiable here because investigators get the option of changing it to a d8 later, or even rolling twice and taking the higher.

To the right of each skill there's now a cog you can click that will open a menu:

- Override the base die (only thing I know of that does this is the `Empathy` investigator talent that let's them roll twice and keep the higher, but there could be something else out there, or any homebrew rules)
- Bonus is for any other permanent bonuses you have that need a die roll
- the checkbox reads the global skill config inspiration value

If you have static bonuses, use the built in change system -- this is only necessary to cover a limitation in that you can't have changes based on die rolls -- they're cachced when the buff is turned on. So if you have a 1d6 in a change, and turn the buff on, then it rolls immediately when you turn the buff on and keeps that specific value until the buff is toggled later.
