Mod for pf1 that automatically determines flank bonuses for allies based on token placement and which token is being targeted.

## todo
- add logic for when an ally moves and whether or not that gives me flanking
- better handling for when the tokens-that-want-flanking are larger than medium (i.e. larger than one square)
- figure out a way to determine if a hunter is flanking with his pet (assuming he still has the class ability that allows them to get adjacency-flanking)
- start filling in method that determines if a token _can't_ be flanked
