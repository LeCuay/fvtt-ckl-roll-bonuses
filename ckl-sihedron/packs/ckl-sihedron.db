{"_id":"OHK1X2ARPQ9ABa87","name":"Sihedron [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"worlds/return-of-the-runelords/Sihedron.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The <em>Sihedron </em>is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the power </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the <em>Sihedron </em>as more than </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he&rsquo;d </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">unified nature of the nation&rsquo;s peoples. Each of the <em>Sihedron</em>&rsquo;s </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">nation of Thassilon was made of different races&mdash;Azlanti, </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">merely making the <em>Sihedron </em>a symbol of harmony and diversity, </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">though, and built into its functionality significant advantages </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">powers granted by the <em>Sihedron </em>are greatest when it is used not </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">themselves swiftly and without a second thought.</span></p>\n<p>Alas, Xin&rsquo;s ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the <em>Sihedron</em>. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon.</p>\n<p>The <em>Sihedron </em>itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the <em>Sihedron </em>rune&rsquo;s distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles.</p>\n<p>Once the <em>Sihedron </em>is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the <em>Sihedron</em>, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action&mdash;the <em>Sihedron </em>immediately rises up into the air behind the user&rsquo;s head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the <em>Sihedron </em>is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">ways treated as if it were an attended </span>object being held or carried. The <em>Sihedron </em>implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way</p>\n<p>Once activated, the <em>Sihedron</em> protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a @Compendium[pf1.spells.vl7yer8k1leyuxld]{Foresight} spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the <em>Sihedron </em>can target its wearer with @Compendium[pf1.spells.mxqi375ya2rka7cp]{True Resurrection} the instant he is slain&mdash;he need not activate this power, as the <em>Sihedron </em>automatically triggers if the user is killed.</p>\n<p>When the user activates the <em>Sihedron</em>, he may select one of the star&rsquo;s points to be &ldquo;ascendant.&rdquo; The <em>Sihedron </em>rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an &ldquo;oppositional&rdquo; point. The effects granted by each of the <em>Sihedron</em>&rsquo;s points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description.</p>\n<p>As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the <em>Sihedron </em>may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The <em>Sihedron&nbsp;</em></span>teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing&nbsp;each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the <em>Sihedron </em>is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the <em>Sihedron </em>is ascendant,&nbsp;even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point.</p>\n<p>Each of the <em>Sihedron</em>&rsquo;s arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the <em>Sihedron </em>is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant.</p>\n<p><strong>Charity</strong>: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and @Compendium[pf1.spells.0vmz2klcfvkc3h0v]{Dimensional Anchor} as a spell-like ability.
